# Langing Page

- mandrill vs. sendgrill
- watch mandrill videos
- how to link with mailchimp
- user goes to page, enters email, hits send, email gets sent
= taken to a page with the download link
- back end for me to see who has signed up,
- when user enters email, it checks to see if the user is there, 
- if they have entered it before, then it gets deleted, adds it again, 
- to avoid repeat emails
- back end, I can add the background photo, and the pdf
- friendly id to search title
- create admin section, no sign=up, only I can sign up
